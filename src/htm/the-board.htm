					The board is the people in the antenna that on their free time take on the tasks needed to run the organisation and keep it alive. These tasks are replying to messages, fill reports, create promotional material and organise events.

				Become member of the board
			</h2>
			<p class="dropcap">
				Being member of the board means to devote a bit of your free time to help to run our lovely antenna. We know that you're bussy studing or working full-time. We'll provide you with information and help in your role at the board. Knowledge transfer is a very important step for the right working of the antenna.
			</p>
			<p class="Mt(1vw) Pt(6vw)--mo">
				In order to become member of the board:
			</p>
			<ul class="Mt(0.5vw)">
				<li class="Pt(2vw)--mo">
					You need to know what is AEGEE. You need to have been member of some AEGEE antenna previously for at least 6 months.
				</li>
				<li class="Pt(2vw)--mo">
					You want and have the time to be commited to AEGEE-London and make sure you carry out the tasks assigned to your board position.
				</li>
				<li class="Pt(2vw)--mo">
					Some board position must be vacant.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Mt(1vw) Pt(2vw)--mo">
				<span class="b">You don't need to be member of the board to put your two cents</span>. If you don't want to be so commited yet want to help, by just having friends or contacts which would be happy to become member of AEGEE-London and you let them know about our local events, that would be a very good way to contribute.

				This document is the contract between AEGEE and the London antenna which contains ten articles that must be followed by both parts and that establishes the official birth of the London antenna. Eszter Bangó (first antenna's president, the blond girl behind the lectern) and Maarten Veldmans (one of the founders, on the pic holding the microphone) attended the Agora in Mannheim, Germany, to sign the Convention.

AEGEE-London was one of the AEGEE funding antennae together with Paris, Leiden, Madrid, Milan and Munich. It existed until at least 1990. However, afterwars, it died. Before 2013 it was again refunded, but the current fundation doesn't know exactly when.
